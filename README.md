# intro

## weekly presentations

  * each week we will read 2 articles, one from neuro, one from graph-stats
  * one person will present each article
  * that person will create a new repo in the https://github.com/Statistical-Connectomics-Sp15/
  * that repo will contain the article, other background reading, and the presentation
  * i recommend latex beamer or keynote, you are free to make presentations however you like, including chalk talks
  * these presentations are for you: reading papers, understanding them, and giving talks are all really important parts of doing science, so it is important to practice and get feedback.

## homework

  * homework will be asking >2 questions of the presenter before the next presentation
  * presenter has to address each question within a week of the due date of the question
  * these assignments are for you: thinking about the content even after it is presented can help consolidate the information in your head, it also gives you an opportunity to provide feedback to your classmates on what was clear, and what was not, so they can improve the presentation

## course project
  
  * there will be a course project due the last day possible,
  * you will again make a github repo
  * you will implement some statistical graph method to answer some neuroscientific problem
  * the grading system will be: i will pull the repo, follow and necessary install instructions, and type 'make', or some such.  if code runs, figures are generated, and report is complied, you get an A. otherwise, an F. i recommend having your friends check before handing it in. 

## TA

  *  i want one, if you are auditing the class, and want money, and are willing to do a trivial amount of work, let me know.
